foreign and international copyright and trade secret laws. 

ALNA retains all rights, title and interest in the Software and you shall

trade name, trademark or other proprietary or intellectual property rights 
related thereto.

You agree to take all reasonable steps to safeguard the secrecy of said 
confidential information and information concerning it, and to prevent the 
unauthorized disclosure thereof. 

Except for the specific rights granted by this Agreement, you shall not

efforts to (i) promptly notify ALNA in writing of such requirement to 
disclose, and (ii) cooperate fully with ALNA in protecting against any 
such disclosure or obtaining a protective order.  Money damages will not 
be an adequate remedy if this Section 8 or Sections 2 through 6 are

equitable remedies, be entitled to an injunction or similar equitable 
relief against such breach or threatened breach without the necessity of
